Our project WavePointer makes human computer interaction simple by making use of Hand Gestures. The computer requires almost no direct contact.
Currently, wireless mouse or a Bluetooth mouse still use a battery for power and a receiver to connect it to the PC. In the proposed system, this limitation can be overcome by employing webcam or a built-in camera.
All I/O operations can be virtually controlled by using static and dynamic hand gestures. This project makes use of the state-of-art Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to recognize hand gestures. It leverages models such as CNN implemented by MediaPipe running on top of pybind11.
Currently it works on Windows platform.
WavePointerâ€™s domains are not restricted as in our application can be used in diverse domain by all type of users ranging from regular user to industry professionals.
